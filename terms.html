            <h2>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h2>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of this website,
              including any related calls, texts or other communications, will be
              resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you
              may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. This
              includes claims against our clients, vendors, and Marketing Partners,
              which are third party beneficiaries, of the arbitration agreement. The
              Federal Arbitration Act and Federal Arbitration law apply to this
              agreement.
              <br />
    
              There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an
              arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an
              individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
              injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must
              follow the terms of these terms as a court would.
              <br />
              The arbitration may be conducted by the American Arbitration
              Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary
              Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are
              available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may choose
              to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
              submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another
              mutually agreed on location.
              <br />
              We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
              conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated
              or representative action. If, for any reason, a claim
              <br />
              proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right
              to a jury trial. We also agree that you or we may bring suit in court
              to enjoin infringement or another misuse of intellectual property
              rights.
              <br />
              In the rate quote application, photos are of models; testimonials are
              from actual The Pheonix Quotes policyholders.
